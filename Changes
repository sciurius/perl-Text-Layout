Revision history for Text::Layout

0.000

	Improve bounding box and line spacing determination by using the
	font ascender and descender values only.
	Allow ascender and decender to be overruled in the font config.
	Adapt some of the example programs to run on Microsoft Windows.

0.030	2022-09-03

	Enable xx-small, medium, large, x-large and xx-large.
	Enable byte-access to built-in Symbol and ZapfDingbats fonts.

0.029	2022-03-17

	Fix issue #11 (PDF::Builder only).
	Fix font changes for Markdown.
	Fix <span rise> in convenience mode.
	Handle <span background>.

0.028	2022-02-04

	INCOMPATIBLE: In Pango mode, the direction of rise and lower
	has been reversed and is no longer proportional to the font size.
	In convenience mode you can use percentages and points..

	INCOMPATIBLE: Extent boxes are now relative to top-left. This
	is Pango compatible and makes the box fit when drawn at the
	same coordinates the layout was rendered.
	
	(Internal) Add extents method for CID fonts.
	More Pango compatibility.
	Add font properties direction and language.
	Add 'pt' postfix for point sizes in markup.

0.027	2021-12-23

	Pango compatibility (POSSIBLY INCOMPATIBLE):
	get_{pixel_}extents now returns the layout extents in scalar
	context. In this case, ink extents are not calculated.
	Improve performance (15%) by cacheing bbox.

0.026	2021-12-22

	Add tests for markup parsing.
	Update example in README.
	Add 'nosubset' property for fonts.
	POSSIBLY INCOMPATIBLE: Fix issue #10. The difference will only
	be noticable when you query the width for centered/right
	aligned texts.
	UNLIKELY INCOMPATIBLE: method set_pango_scale does now enable/disable.
	The scaling is fixed to PANGO_SCALE (1024).
	Fixed some issues with pango scaling.
	Fix regression that sometimes tripled the resultant PDF.

0.025	2021-10-22

	Add font config properties underline_thickness,
	strikeline_position, strikeline_thickness, overline_position,
	overline_thickness, and strikeline_position. Overriding the
	font specified/calculated values may improve results for some
	fonts. Note that strikeline_thickness and overline_thickness
	will default to underline_thickness if set.

	Withdraw a and link aliases for href. They may serve a
	different purpose in the future.

0.024	2021-10-21

	Retain case sensitivity for links.

	Remove debugging info.

0.023	2021-10-21

	Add support for underline, overline and strike, and their
	colours.

	Add support for hyperlinks (span attributes a, href and link).

	specification.

0.020	2021-05-18

	Use common font cache for PDFAPI.
	Handle some more weight variants.
	Added testing PDF::Builder unless it is of an incompatible
	version. As of 3.019 PDF::Builder changed the font metrics to
	compatible values.

0.019	2020-08-16

	Add support for C<< <span font_desc="..."> >>. See
	tests/pdfapi3.pl for an example how to use this to embed RTL
	texts. Note, however, that this currently relies on the native
	harfbuzz library to correctly determine ('guess') the
	characteristics of the text.

	Eliminated backend loading in favour of derived classes.

	Enable font caching for PDF::API2.

0.018.3	2020-05-19

	Dropped testing with PDF::Builder. Text::Layout will continue
	to work with PDF::Builder to the extent that it is compatible
	with PDF::API2.

0.018.2	2020-05-09

	Avoid testing PDF::Builder if it is of an incompatible
	version. As of 3.018 PDF::Builder changed the font metrics to
	incompatible values.
